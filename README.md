# Unified Agent System for Claude Code

A comprehensive AI agent system with **68 specialized agents** designed for modern software development. Features **advanced AI orchestration**, integrated resilience engineering, structured logging, and live MCP integrations across all frameworks.

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/avivl/claude-007-agents.git
cd claude-007-agents
```

### 2. Choose Your Installation Method

#### Option A: Global Installation (Recommended for Power Users)
Install the agent system globally and configure Claude Code to use it automatically:

```bash
# Install globally (choose a permanent location)
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/claude-agents
sudo cp -r /path/to/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents /usr/local/share/claude-agents/

# Or install to your home directory (no sudo required)
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/claude-agents
cp -r /path/to/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents ~/.local/share/claude-agents/

# Configure Claude Code globally (create/edit ~/.claude/config.json)
mkdir -p ~/.claude
cat > ~/.claude/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "agents": {
    "globalPath": "/usr/local/share/claude-agents/agents",
    "fallbackToLocal": true
  }
}
EOF

# Or for home directory installation:
cat > ~/.claude/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "agents": {
    "globalPath": "~/.local/share/claude-agents/agents",
    "fallbackToLocal": true
  }
}
EOF
```

**Alternative: Global Symlink (Best for Development)**
```bash
# Clone to a permanent location
git clone https://github.com/avivl/claude-007-agents.git ~/.local/share/claude-007-agents

# Configure Claude Code to use the repository directly
cat > ~/.claude/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "agents": {
    "globalPath": "~/.local/share/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents",
    "fallbackToLocal": true
  }
}
EOF

# Update anytime with:
cd ~/.local/share/claude-007-agents && git pull
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Install once, use everywhere
- ✅ No per-project setup required
- ✅ Consistent agent experience across all projects
- ✅ Easy updates (just update the global installation)
- ✅ Clean project repositories (no agent files)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires Claude Code configuration
- ❌ Less flexibility for project-specific agent customization
- ❌ Dependency on global installation path

#### Option B: Copy Files (Recommended for Most Projects)
Copy the agent system to your project directory:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create the agents directory
mkdir -p .claude

# Copy all agent files
cp -r /path/to/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents .claude/

# Verify installation
ls .claude/agents/
# Should show: orchestrator.md, orchestrators/, universal/, backend/, frontend/, etc.
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full ownership of agent files in your project
- ✅ Can customize agents for your specific needs
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Works with version control (agents evolve with your project)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Manual updates required when the system improves
- ❌ Larger project size

#### Option C: Symlink (Recommended for Development/Multiple Projects)
Create symbolic links to the agent system:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create the .claude directory
mkdir -p .claude

# Create symlink to the agents directory
ln -s /path/to/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents .claude/agents

# Verify symlink
ls -la .claude/
# Should show: agents -> /path/to/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automatic updates when you pull the latest agent system
- ✅ Smaller project footprint
- ✅ Perfect for development and experimentation
- ✅ Share improvements across multiple projects

**Cons:**
- ❌ Dependency on external repository
- ❌ Potential issues if the source repository moves
- ❌ Less suitable for production deployments

### 3. Verify Installation

Test that the agents are properly installed:

#### For Global Installation:
```bash
# Test from any directory
cd /any/project/directory

# Test with Claude Code (should automatically find global agents)
claude "List available agents"

# Test orchestrator functionality
claude "Use @team-configurator to analyze my project structure"

# Verify global configuration
cat ~/.claude/config.json
```

#### For Project-Specific Installation:
```bash
# Check agent directory structure in your project
ls .claude/agents/
# Expected output: orchestrator.md, orchestrators/, universal/, backend/, frontend/, business/, infrastructure/, etc.

# Test with Claude Code
claude "List available agents"

# Test with a simple orchestrator command
claude "Use @team-configurator to analyze my project structure"
```

### 4. Update Your Installation

#### Global Installation Updates:
```bash
# For copied global installation
cd /path/to/claude-007-agents
git pull
sudo cp -r .claude/agents/* /usr/local/share/claude-agents/agents/
# Or for home directory: cp -r .claude/agents/* ~/.local/share/claude-agents/agents/

# For global symlink installation
cd ~/.local/share/claude-007-agents
git pull
# Updates are automatic due to symlink
```

#### Project-Specific Updates:
```bash
# For copied files
cd /path/to/claude-007-agents
git pull
cp -r .claude/agents/* /path/to/your/project/.claude/agents/

# For project symlinks
cd /path/to/claude-007-agents
git pull
# Updates are automatic due to symlink
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Auto-Configuration (Recommended)

**Step 1: Analyze Your Project**
```bash
# Analyze your project and get team configuration recommendations
claude "Use @team-configurator to analyze my project structure"
```

**Step 2: Generate CLAUDE.md File**
```bash
# Create your personalized CLAUDE.md based on the analysis (RECOMMENDED)
claude "Use @team-configurator to analyze my project structure. Based on the team configuration analysis, create a CLAUDE.md file for my project"
```

This two-step process will automatically:
- 🔍 **Detect your stack** (Rails, Django, React, TypeScript, Go, etc.)
- 🤖 **Configure specialists** with resilience and logging integration  
- 📋 **Generate team recommendations** with optimal agent configurations
- 🎯 **Provide usage examples** tailored to your project
- ⚠️ **Include critical commit requirements** at the top of CLAUDE.md
- ✅ **Add pre-commit checklist** with project-specific guidance
- 📚 **Include commit examples** with proper agent attribution

### Alternative CLAUDE.md Creation Methods

```bash
# Option A: Single command (recommended for new projects)
claude "Use @team-configurator to analyze my project structure. Based on the team configuration analysis, create a CLAUDE.md file for my project"

# Option B: Two separate commands
claude "Use @team-configurator to analyze my project structure"
claude "Based on the team configuration analysis, create a CLAUDE.md file for my project"

# Option C: Copy and customize the template (manual approach)
cp CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md
# Then edit to match your project's specific needs
```

### What Your Generated CLAUDE.md Will Include:

✅ **Critical Requirements Section** (at the very top):
- Prominent commit message requirements warning
- Pre-commit checklist with 4 mandatory steps
- Project-specific guidance for different change types

✅ **Project-Optimized Content**:
- 📝 **Your personalized agent team** optimized for your technology stack
- 🎯 **Usage examples** specific to your project architecture  
- 🔧 **Workflow configurations** tailored to your development process
- 📊 **Agent relationships** and collaboration patterns

✅ **Detailed Guidelines Section**:
- Complete commit message format requirements
- At least 4 different commit examples with agent attribution
- Implementation notes about automatic agent name appending

### 📝 Automatic Agent Attribution in Commits

Once you have a CLAUDE.md file in your project, **all commit messages will automatically include the agents that contributed to the code**:

```bash
# Your commits will automatically look like this:
feat(auth): implement user authentication system - @rails-backend-expert @security-auditor
fix(api): resolve connection timeout issues - @go-resilience-engineer @performance-optimizer
docs(readme): update installation instructions - @documentation-specialist
refactor(db): optimize query performance - @database-admin @performance-optimizer
```

**How it works:**
- 🤖 Claude Code automatically detects which agents worked on your changes
- ✅ Agent names are appended to every commit message without you asking
- 🔍 Provides complete traceability of which agents contributed to each change
- 📊 Essential for project maintenance and code archaeology

**This happens automatically** - you don't need to remember to add agent names manually!

### Manual Setup
1. **Use agents directly**: `"Use rails-backend-expert to build authentication with circuit breakers"`
2. **Leverage orchestration**: `"Use @orchestrator to build a scalable e-commerce platform"`
3. **Extend the system** by creating new agents with provided templates
